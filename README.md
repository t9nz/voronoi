# Voronoi

Simple Python computational geometry code for computing 
voronoi diagrams, and its dual graph, the Delauney triangulation.

## Description

**Voronoi diagrams** are a type of tesselation pattern that emerges when every point in a plane is 
segmented into n cells through the computation of euclidean distances for a given set of n points.

For example, if n = 6, then the euclidean distance between every point in the plane and each n-th given
point will be calculated. Each point will be colour-assigned to whichever n-th point it is closest to, 
creating colour-separated sites. 

The pattern of voronoi diagrams may look familiar, that's because it shows up quite often: from cells 
to giraffe coat patterns. You can read more about it here, from this article which inspired me to 
create this repository. [the-fascinating-world-of-voronoi-diagrams](https://towardsdatascience.com/the-fascinating-world-of-voronoi-diagrams-da8fc700fa1b#:~:text=Voronoi%20patterns%20in%20nature&text=From%20microscopic%20cells%20in%20onion,that%20they%20form%20efficient%20shapes.)

**Delauney triangulations** are known as the dual graph of the Voronoi diagrams. The Delauney is an efficient
triangulation in which for a given set of points, no point is inside the circumcircle of any triangle within
the Delauney triangulation.
